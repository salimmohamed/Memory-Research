# Game Memory Research Framework

## ⚠️ Educational Purpose Disclaimer

This project is developed **STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY**. It is designed to:

- Demonstrate fundamental concepts of memory management in modern games
- Explore security mechanisms implemented in multiplayer environments
- Provide insights into anti-cheat technology and protection methods
- Serve as a practical study in cybersecurity principles and memory analysis techniques

**Under no circumstances** should this framework be used to:
- Gain unfair advantages in online games
- Disrupt the gaming experience of other players
- Circumvent anti-cheat systems in a production environment
- Violate any terms of service or end-user license agreements

The techniques illustrated in this project are shared solely to promote understanding of cybersecurity concepts, memory forensics, and to encourage the development of more robust security implementations.

## Project Overview

This framework demonstrates various memory analysis techniques for studying game memory structures. It utilizes Direct Memory Access (DMA) concepts to illustrate how games manage and protect their memory space.

### Features

- Memory scanning and pattern recognition
- Process memory map visualization
- Real-time memory structure analysis
- Security mechanism detection
- ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) visualization techniques
- Aimbot concepts implementation (for educational demonstration only)

### Planned Additions

- Memory modification detection analysis
- Anti-cheat bypass detection demonstrations
- Memory encryption/obfuscation studies
- Network packet analysis framework
- Hardware-assisted memory protection research

## Technical Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019/2022
- Windows 10/11
- DirectX SDK
- MemProcFS dependencies (see [Installation Guide](./Instructions.md))
- FTDI libraries

## Installation and Setup

Please follow the detailed [Installation Guide](./Instructions.md) to set up the development environment properly.

## Ethical Considerations

Memory analysis techniques, while valuable for research and educational purposes, carry significant ethical responsibilities. We encourage:

- Always obtaining proper authorization before analyzing any software
- Reporting security vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure channels
- Contributing to the improvement of security mechanisms
- Sharing knowledge to help developers create more secure applications
